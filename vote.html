        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Electronic voting is the process of casting and counting votes through electronic means. While it may seem like a convenient and modern way of conducting elections, there are several dangers associated with it that pose a threat to the integrity of the democratic process.</p>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>Security Concerns</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest concerns with electronic voting is the potential for hacking and manipulation of the voting system. Hackers could potentially interfere with the voting process by altering or manipulating the results, leading to a compromise of the election's integrity. In addition, the use of electronic voting systems can also expose the personal information of voters, potentially leading to identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>

      <section id="transparency">
        <h2>Lack of Transparency</h2>
        <p>Another issue with electronic voting is the lack of transparency in the process. Unlike traditional paper-based voting, it can be difficult to perform audits and recounts in the event of a disputed election. This can lead to a loss of public trust in the electoral process, as well as calls for investigations and potentially, civil unrest.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, electronic voting has several dangers that can pose a threat to the integrity of the democratic process. While it may seem like a convenient solution, the potential for hacking, manipulation, and lack of transparency makes it a problematic choice. It is important to carefully consider the potential risks before adopting electronic voting systems, and to work towards solutions that can address these concerns and ensure the security and integrity of the election process.</p>
